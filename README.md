## Inspiration
In countries and communities with high unemployment rates such as Kenya, Afghanistan and Venezulea; we wanted to provide the people in these communities the ability to connect to the global marketplace. With Craft for a Cause, we connect international buyers to communities across the globe.

We have created a web application store containing crafts which our communities are able to create and we handle the distribution. We would use an online virtual learning environment to train the members of the community to create their own unique, local and bespoke craft items. We also provide basic mobile phones to these communites, for those without cellular data but with a SMS signal, to provide details of their orders to allow them to begin their craft.

By using this platform we aim to stimulate the economy in the local areas and communities by providing them with the profits from the sale of their crafts while Craft for a Cause takes a small cut to allow for operation.
